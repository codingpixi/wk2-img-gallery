Assignment: Image Gallery
You can add 8 images that you love from your life (pictures of your kids, your spouse or significant other, pictures you’ve taken -- the list goes on and on) or any random selection of pictures from a site like Unsplash. 

Images should:
All be the same height (done via CSS)
Have a bit of space between each image
Have alt text

Site should:
Be responsive. We should be able to see this on our laptop, our tablets, or our phones and see all your hard work!
Be deployed via surge.sh

Code should:
Contain media queries, flexbox, or a mixture of both
Be version controlled via GitHub
Contain more than one git commit (commit often so we can see the progress)

Your assignment will be marked complete when you’ve submitted a Google Doc via Google Classroom in the Assignment section with:
A link to your surge.sh site
A link to your GitHub repository containing all of your code
